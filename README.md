# Live Coding Scripts

This repository contains a collection of creative coding scripts that I have written. The scripts are primarily in JavaScript, using [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and a few in three.js and Python. The scripts are organized into folders based on the libraries used. I use these as references for my live coding performances.

## Running the Scripts

- The Hydra scripts can be run locally using [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the `atom-hydra` plugin or directly in the [Hydra online editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/).
- The syntax used in this repository is slightly condensed, as `atom-hydra` does not handle empty lines well.
- p5.js scripts have been adapted to a syntax compatible with Hydra.
- python scripts migth setting up a virtual environment and installing the required packages. You can do this by installing the packages listed in the requirements file.

## Repository Style
The structure and organization of this repository are inspired by shader collections for Hydra.
